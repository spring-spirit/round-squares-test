For a quick start on a local machine
1. Rename the `apps/backend/env.template` file to `apps/backend/.env`
2. Create a user with the configuration file from `apps/backend/.env` in the PG locations
3. Run `yarn setup` from the root directory; this will install all the necessary frontend and backend modules
4. Run `yarn start:dev` from the root directory; this will start the frontend and backend via nx
